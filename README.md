<h1>Welcome.</h1>

Within these repositories you'll find a lot of good code and a lot of bad code. I began learning to code with <a href='theodinproject.com'> The Odin Project</a> in April 2020 and quickly learned what a div is. 

Since then, I've learned a lot about JavaScript, React, git, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, webpack, TDD, databases, working with API's, and everything in between. 

I'm currently working through the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript'> Advanced JavaScript </a> section in Odin. And in the future,
I'd like to learn more about optimizing performance and scalability. 

Ultimately, I'd like to work with a team programming something that makes the world a better place. Until then, I've got some bugs to work out. 

I'd love to hear from you -- brendonhenning@gmail.com.
